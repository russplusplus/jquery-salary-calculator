# JQuery Salary Calculator

This assignment gave us practice using JQuery to manipulate the DOM and perform calculations behind the scenes.

## Description

The application has an input form that collects employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary.

A 'Submit' button collects the form information, stores the information to calculate monthly costs, appends information to the DOM, and clears the input fields. Using the stored information, monthly costs are calculated and appended to the DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, a red background color is added to the total monthly cost.

A delete button removes an employee from the DOM. It does not remove that Employee's salary from the reported total.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery
